# Annotation Cycle

The annotation cycle is the primary quality control loop.

Steps:
1. Generate first `plan.md`.
2. Add inline notes.
3. Request plan update, no implementation.
4. Repeat until no ambiguity remains.

Typical notes:
- Assumption corrections
- Scope reduction
- Backward compatibility constraints
- Over-engineering removal

Minimum target: 2 iterations.
